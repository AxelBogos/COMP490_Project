1,a us [MASK] court has issued a temporary injunction blocking plans by the obama administration to increase funding for stem cell research .,"the court ruled in favour of researchers who say human embryonic stem cell research involved the destruction of human embryos . judge royce lamberth said lawsuits brought against the new guidelines could now go ahead . president obama lifted a ban on funding for stem cell research in march . critics say the ban , which was kept in place by mr obama ' s predecessor , george w bush , impeded the fight to find treatments for diseases like alzheimer ' s , parkinson ' s and diabetes . the suit , which was also backed by some christian groups , is against the national institutes of health ( nih ) . those against the new plan to increase funding argued the nih policy violated us law and also took funds from researchers seeking to work with adult stem cells . "" esc ( embryonic stem cell ) research is clearly research in which an embryo is destroyed , "" judge lamberth said . he added : "" to conduct esc research , escs must be derived from an embryo . the process of deriving escs from an embryo results in the destruction of the embryo . thus esc research necessarily depends upon the destruction of a human embryo .
