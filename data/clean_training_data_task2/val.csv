or whether it would just fly off and miss jupiter completely . luckily , it successfully began its orbit on tuesday . it ' s part of a special mission to help scientists find out more about our biggest planet , and how the solar system began . juno blasted off in 2011 , and will now orbit jupiter 32 times - floating just 3 , 100 miles above the planet ' s cloud tops , for around one year . during this time it will be gathering lots of research and feeding it back to scientists here on earth . there will also be three passengers on the spacecraft - these three lego figures . they are the roman god jupiter , his wife juno and the 17th century italian astronomer galileo galilei . they had to be made from aluminium rather than plastic so they could cope with the extreme conditions of going into space . juno ' s main goal is to try to understand how jupiter was formed and how it has changed over the years . scientists hope that by researching this , they will have a better idea of how other giant gas planets are created in different solar systems as well as our own . this is because jupiter is one of our largest planets , and it ' s likely it was one of the first planets in our solar system to form when a huge cloud of dust and gas collapsed more than four million years ago . it ' s mostly made from two gases , hydrogen and helium , which are also present in the sun . so , scientists think that by studying jupiter ' s atmosphere they will learn more about how our planets formed . jupiter has a very thick layer of gas and cloud surrounding it . scientists hope that by observing these clouds , and discovering what they are made of , monitoring their temperature , and movements , they can learn more about the planet and other gas planets . one of the things they are hoping to find out , is how much water and ammonia is in jupiter ' s atmosphere . researchers are hoping to find out whether or not jupiter has a solid core in the middle of the planet . as it is covered in a thick layer of gas , it has been very hard for scientists to learn more about its structure in the past . however , juno is equipped with some pretty special gadgets which they are hoping will reveal the secrets of jupiter ' s centre . it will help to research jupiter ' s gravitational and magnetic fields , to help figure out how big its core is , or if it even has one ! a nasa spacecraft [MASK] juno has begun its orbit of the planet jupiter .",state,called,company,provides,represents,1
