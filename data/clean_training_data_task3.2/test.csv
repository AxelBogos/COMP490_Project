"" i ' m very clear this is my absolute focus here , "" he said .","sinn fa©in and the sdlp have claimed his recent comments on the legacy of the troubles mean he cannot be an honest broker in negotiations . but mr brokenshire said he is very much looking forward to the discussions . voters go to the polls on 2 march after the power - sharing executive collapsed over a botched energy scheme . asked about whether it would be useful to introduce an independent chair for the legacy elements of the talks , the secretary of state said the focus should be on using the three - week period after the election to get the stormont executive back up and running . "" as secretary of state for northern ireland , i take the lead responsibility for the uk government and i very much look forward to getting into discussions with the parties immediately following the election , doing all that i can to support work to get us back into devolved government , "" he said . in an article for the sunday telegraph , mr brokenshire wrote that there was a "" disproportionate focus "" on the investigation of troubles killings carried out by former soldiers and police officers . since then , the psni legacy branch has released figures showing that killings by the army account for only about 30 % of its workload . asked whether these figures contradicted his view , the secretary of state insisted that the overall framework for dealing with the past was not as balanced as it should be . "" i think that there is an issue in relation to the overall framework , the systems that are frankly not delivering for anyone in relation to legacy . that is why i do feel very keenly that we do need reform , "" he said . he said one objective of any future talks would be to "" create a system that starts to work , because at the moment this is failing everyone "" . mr brokenshire said he stood by comments ruling out special status for northern ireland within the eu . however , he added that the brexit negotiations would take into account special factors such as the border , the single electricity market and cross - border health care . on the question of whether or not he was likely to be in charge of northern ireland via a return to direct rule by the summer , the secretary of state insisted that he was "" not contemplating anything other than a continuation of devolved government in northern ireland "" .
